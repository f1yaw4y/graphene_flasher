### This tool is not deprecated due to GrapheneOS's web flasher. 
This tool only supports Pixel 6 & older; there's no reason to improve this script anymore. Please use the GrapheneOS web flashed instead as it is easier and faster

Simple script for installing GrapheneOS on Pixel phones. 

-Takes care of platform-tools

-Download/unzip/verify

-Re-locks bootloader
